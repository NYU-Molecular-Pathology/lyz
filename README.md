- __NOTE: Under Construction!!__

- Setup as a submodule and subdirectory of [NYU-Molecular-Pathology/protocols](https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/protocols), and references files from there.

This module will check on the status of the various DNA sequencers used by the lab, and will run automatic processing scripts on new data.
